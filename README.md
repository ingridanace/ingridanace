## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m super fresh at this but hear me out: I will make it, I will be a Data Scientist!

# ðŸ“‹ To do list (Summer):

- Digging through Kaggle and creating some cool dashboards using the Power BI skills I recently learned
- Read at least one programming book that builds on my current skill set

# ðŸ“² Personal Life updates (Summer):

- Almost done with the house constructionâ€”slowly moving in!
- Fixing up my public profiles to get job-ready for the fall!
